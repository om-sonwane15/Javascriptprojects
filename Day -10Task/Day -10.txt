Day -10 R&D on Postman and API, how it works

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs allow developers to fetch or send data between a client (frontend) and a server (backend).

Postman is a popular API testing tool that helps developers interact with APIs, send requests, inspect responses, and debug issues before integrating them into their JavaScript applications.

Postman allows to-
Send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Inspect API responses
Add headers, parameters, and authentication
Automate API testing

To run frontend and backend files-
weather-app> npm run dev for app.jsx
backend> nodemon server.js for server.js file

GET - http://localhost:5000/
Postman output: Welcome to the Weather API!
