Event Handling in React JS

Event handling in React.js is how we make our apps interactiveâ€”responding to things like button clicks, text input, mouse movements, or even key presses. Events in React use a special system called synthetic events, which makes them work consistently across different browsers.

For example, if I want event to occur when a button is clicked, onClick and attach a function to it. The same goes for text inputs (onChange), hovering (onMouseOver), or key presses (onKeyPress). React also gives access to an event object, which tells details like which key was pressed or where the mouse was clicked. It also allows to work dynamically.

Events that are used-
1)onClick -Triggered when an element is clicked   <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
2)onChange -Fires when input value changes	  <input onChange={handleChange} />
3)onMouseOver -Fires when mouse hovers over an element	<div onMouseOver={handleHover}>Hover</div>
4)onKeyPress -Detects keypress in an input field	<input onKeyPress={handleKeyPress} />
5)onFocus -Fires when an input field is focused	<input onFocus={handleFocus} />
6)onBlur -Fires when an input field loses focus	<input onBlur={handleBlur} />
