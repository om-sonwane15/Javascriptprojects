Day -1 REST API and Crud operation

The REST API -(representational state transfer application programming interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. We use post, get, put or delete request of a web URL as HTTP which is from client to server side.

The CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) are mapped to HTTP methods that are the four basic operations for managing data in database or application.
Create(post) is used to add new data.
Read(get) is used to retrieve or view the existing data. 
Update(put) is used to update or modify the data. 
Delete(delete) is used to remove the data.
