R&D on NodeJS and how to create a server with the help of ExpressJS.

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment and library that is used for running web applications outside the client’s browser.

It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.js is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

To create simple server with express.js, install node.js and initialize new node.js project (npm init -y) this creates a package.json file.

Then install Express.js (npm install express)

Example-
Create a Simple Express Server-
const express = require('express');  
const app = express();              

const PORT = 3000;
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, This is Express.js Server');
});
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log('server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}');
});

To run the server-
node server.js OR nodemon server.js

To test the server-http://localhost:3000

Node.js provides a powerful environment for server-side development.
Express.js makes it easy to build APIs and web servers with simple syntax.
